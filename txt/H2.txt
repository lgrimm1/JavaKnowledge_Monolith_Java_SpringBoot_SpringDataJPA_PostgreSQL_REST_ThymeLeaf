H2
=================================================================================
The H2 is an in-memory relational database system.
Database names, column names, index names etc. should be lowercase.
Typically, H2 is used when no psychical database is available or fitting for the task or for the purpose of testing when no specific database connection parameters should be set.
H2 accepts all generally used key types and column types. Due to one of its main purpose (testing independently of actual psychical databases), recognizes most of the possible column data types. Be aware of using database-specific (exotic) column types e.g. TEXT[] (specific for PostgreSQL).
Please note, unless set to have file-based storage, H2 will be re-launched with data loss along with application re-loading.
H2 uses the same port as the application (8080 by default).

=================================================================================
1. SETTING UP
=================================================================================
The H2 does not require specific installation. During application build-up Spring will install the needed components into the memory.
On start-up, will create the necessary database automatically.
Settings of H2 can be manipulated via application properties (back-end connection parameters) or built-in console.
The default username and password can be manipulated by the appropriate parameters as well.

=================================================================================
2. CONSOLE
=================================================================================
The console is built-in, can be reached after the current application is started and the proper properties setting enables it. As a result, settings made via its console will be alive only during runtime.
In order to access the console, type the next URL into a browser:
    - http://localhost:8080/h2-console
The console uses the root of the application URL plus the /h2-console endpoint.
In some cases the /h2 endpoint is used, try this first when /h2-console does not work.
The starting page asks connection parameters set in the backend connection parameters.
Work parameters of the console are set via these parameters as well.

3. BACKEND CONNECTION PARAMETERS
=================================================================================
These parameters are declared in the application.properties or a Yaml file under the project directory.
